# Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio
I'm currently learning how to code in a fullStack JS bootcamp with the school O'clock
I'm trying to update this portfolio with what i'm learning. My plan for now is to add javascript interaction to it. 
I have some ideas that i will try to implement in the following weeks.
